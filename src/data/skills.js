      "I start every product initiative by deeply understanding the user and the problem space. Through structured user interviews, stakeholder conversations, and Jobs-To-Be-Done analysis, I uncover the real pain points that matter — not just the symptoms. I've conducted 15+ user interviews across diverse personas and used insights to validate hypotheses before committing engineering resources.",
